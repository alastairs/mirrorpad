# MirrorPad

MirrorPad is a simple web app for collaborating on a range of simple programming problems.  It also has a free-text mode that can be used for any purpose, and functions much like [TypeWith.me](http://typewith.me/).  

## Uses for MirrorPad

MirrorPad can be used for collaborating on documents and more in free-text mode.  It provides a number of built-in programming puzzles of varying levels, and you can also add your own. Why not use it for interviewing candidates?

MirrorPad is looking for a better name :-)
